### Things to discuss on March 24 2016
 - index.html not sync with current md/html files.
 Maybe 12-citation is more useful than 14-supplemental-rstudio

 - How much emphasis do you need to put on 10-12 open science/licensing/hosting 
 - git branch can be very complicated, any plan for intermediate/advanced git lesson (like R)
